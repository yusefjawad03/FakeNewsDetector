As flu season approaches, many people are wondering about the effects of vaccines on their health. There are plenty of misconceptions circulating, so let's set the record straight.
Claim 1: "The COVID-19 vaccine causes infertility in women."
This claim has been widely shared on social media but lacks scientific backing. Multiple studies have shown no link between the COVID-19 vaccine and infertility.
Claim 2: "You can't get the flu from a flu shot."
This is true. The flu shot contains inactivated virus particles that cannot cause the flu.
Claim 3: "COVID-19 vaccines are 100% effective at preventing illness."
This is false. While the vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalization, they are not 100% effective at preventing all infections.
Claim 4: "Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States."
This is a true and well-documented fact according to the CDC.
Claim 5: "Taking high doses of Vitamin C can prevent the flu."
Scientific evidence does not support this claim. While Vitamin C can support immune function, it does not prevent the flu.
