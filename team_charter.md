# Team Charter Template
Last updated: [2024-10-02]

## Team Name: HWPCS

### Team Members:
- Seeam Khan
- Brendan Jarmusz
- Matthew Rosica
- Yusef Jawad

## 1. Project Objectives
*Clearly state the overall purpose of your team and briefly describe your senior design project.*
Our team aims to build an effective and user-friendly fake news detection system that uses machine learning and natural language processing to help users discern reliable information from misinformation. We plan to build a chrome extension for seamless use. 

### 1.1 Specific Goals
*Include a list of the specific components of your solution*

*Example for building ChatGPT:*
- *AI Model: A generative language model trained on large amounts of public data that can accurately and safely respond to user queries.*
- *Compute-efficient backend: A highly scalable backend that can run the ai model and intelligently handle batching requests to optimize gpu efficiency*
- *User-friendly web app: A website with a chat interface that allows users to interact with the model. The website should require authentication and use accounts to manage individual's chat history*

- Fake News Detection Model: A machine learning-based classifier trained to detect misinformation by analyzing language patterns, sources, and factual inconsistencies.
- Backend System: A robust backend to process incoming news articles, interact with the detection model, use fact checking apis, and handle secondary checks using AI.
- Chrome Extension: A clean and simple web extension that allows users to view the credibility of the news on the page their on and receive real-time analysis and credibility scores for the wesite.

## 2. Roles and Responsibilities
